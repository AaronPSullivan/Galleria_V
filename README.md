Galleria_V
==========

Galleria_V is a modification of Aino's JavaScript Image Gallery "Galleria"  at http://galleria.io and the "Classic" 
theme. Galleria_V allows for a vertical carousel and enables fullscreen viewing capability. Galleria_V is not 
compatible with Galleria themes, however themes could be modified or created to function with Galleria_V. 
Galleria_V retains most of the functionality of Galleria but is not provided or supported by Aino.
