Galleria_V
==========

Galleria_V is a modification of an older version of Aino's JavaScript Image Gallery "Galleria" at http://galleria.io
and the "Classic" theme. Galleria_V allows for a vertical carousel and enables fullscreen viewing capability.
Galleria_V is not compatible with Galleria themes, however themes could be modified or created to function with
Galleria_V. Galleria_V retains most of the functionality of Galleria but is not provided or supported by Aino.
